Data Analysis Assignment:

📊 Overview
This project is a Python-based data analysis assignment that demonstrates loading, exploring, and visualizing the classic Iris dataset. The implementation uses pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for creating visualizations.

🎯 Objectives
Load and explore a dataset using pandas

Perform basic data analysis and statistical calculations

Create multiple types of data visualizations

Document findings and observations from the analysis

🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.6+

pandas

matplotlib

scikit-learn

📋 Installation & Setup
Clone or download the project files

Install required packages:

bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Run the analysis:

bash
python iris_analysis.py
📊 Dataset Information
The project uses the Iris dataset from scikit-learn, which contains:

150 samples of iris flowers

4 numerical features:

Sepal length (cm)

Sepal width (cm)

Petal length (cm)

Petal width (cm)

3 species classes:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

🔍 Analysis Performed
1. Data Loading & Exploration
Dataset loading and basic information

Structure examination (rows, columns, data types)

Missing values check

2. Basic Data Analysis
Descriptive statistics (mean, std, min, max, etc.)

Grouped analysis by species

Correlation observations

Key findings about the dataset

3. Data Visualization
Four types of plots generated in a 2×2 grid:

Line Chart: Petal length trends across sample index

Bar Chart: Average petal length by species

Histogram: Distribution of sepal length with mean line

Scatter Plot: Relationship between sepal length and petal length

📈 Key Findings
Setosa species has the smallest petal dimensions

Virginica species has the largest overall measurements

Strong positive correlation exists between petal length and width (0.96)

Petal measurements are more discriminative than sepal measurements

The dataset is perfectly balanced with 50 samples per species

🚀 How to Use
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed

Run the script: python iris_analysis.py

The script will:

Load and analyze the Iris dataset

Display analysis results in the console

Generate a visualization file (iris_analysis.png) in the same directory

📝 Code Features
Clean, well-structured Python code

Comprehensive data exploration

Multiple visualization types

Clear output and documentation

Error-free execution

Beginner-friendly implementation

🎓 Learning Outcomes
This assignment demonstrates:

Practical data manipulation with pandas

Statistical analysis of datasets

Data visualization techniques

Interpretation of data patterns and relationships

Professional reporting of analytical findings

📄 Output
After running the script, you'll get:

Console output with all analysis results

A PNG file (iris_analysis.png) containing all four visualizations

🔧 Customization
To analyze a different dataset:

Replace the dataset loading code

Update the column names and variables accordingly

Adjust visualization parameters as needed
